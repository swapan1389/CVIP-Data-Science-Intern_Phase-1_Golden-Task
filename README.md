The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which is a step-by-step process for data science projects. The steps include:

Business understanding: Understanding the problem that the project is trying to solve.
Data understanding: Exploring the data and understanding its characteristics.
Data preparation: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it ready for modeling.
Modeling: Building and evaluating different machine learning models.
Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the best model on a holdout dataset.
Deployment: Deploying the model to production so that it can be used to make predictions.
The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, and random forests. The best performing model is a random forest model.

The project also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the steps of the project in detail. The notebook is well-documented and easy to follow.

This project is a great example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems. The project is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about machine learning and data science.
